# Manual Archipelago Web Client
Web client for Manual Archipelago worlds. (Replacement for the Manual AP Client)

Hosted at https://rampantepsilon.github.io/ManualAPClient

## One Client to Rule Them All!
I built this client because while I have nothing against the Manual AP Client built from python. I wanted to build something that could also be ran on other devices without much overhead.

This project doesn't use anything major in terms of design or function. If you want to use this locally just download the files and open index.html in your browser.

### Builds
There will be releases with this as progression is made. However, all releases will be using an Electron app. While it's not recommended to use this, it may be a better option for streamers needing a dedicated window with the client.

NOTE: The website linked above will stay up-to-date. The Electron build will be done weekly (at minimum) if needed to catch up. During the Alpha phase, the Electron build may be done multiple times to implement bigger changes.

### Versioning for this app
Versioning will follow the current AP release. However, there will be different builds as the app is developed. This is so that users will know what version of the AP server this will be compatible with.
