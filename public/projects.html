          This application is a major change in the previous TweetDeck client that I previously had listed. The project originally was just to bring back the TweetDeck desktop application that was removed years ago. As I continued working with Electron, I wasn't satisfied with just letting this program do one thing. Instead, I've designed this app as a multi-functional desktop app that can allow you to utilize many different tools from emails, music, Twitter, and more within one application free standing from the browsers we utilize.
          <br><br>
          This app has allowed me to open the door to see exactly what not only Electron but what web development can do and it's now inspired me to look into other Node.JS libraries and JavaScript Frameworks like Vue, Angular, and React. As stated above, the application comes with TweetDeck, Gmail, Yahoo! Mail, AOL Mail, Outlook Mail, YouTube, Twitch, OCRemix Radio, Spotify, Discord, and Google Drive. There are options to only show one of the mail clients as well as only showing one media source. Discord, TweetDeck, and Google Drive are presistent for those that use them frequently as well as there are options to add your own links.
          <br><br>
          While I know this app may never get popular, I enjoy working on and with this app because it's allowed me to reflect on just how much I've learned from Electron, Javascript, and web development altogether and that pushes me to try to keep working on it to make it better than the original app. You can find the source code <a class="link" title="github.com/rampantepsilon/rampantdock" onclick="newTab('https://github.com/rampantepsilon/rampantdock')">HERE</a> or download the application <a class="link" title="github.com/rampantepsilon/rampantdock/releases" onclick="newTab('https://github.com/rampantepsilon/rampantdock/releases')">HERE</a>

          This project came to me when I was watching Games Done Quick on Twitch. While watching, I took a look at their site and saw how clean and readily accessible it was to it's viewers. That's when I started working on this project.
          <br><br>I've been a part of The Gaming Saloon Network  since 2010 when me and a friend started it. Over the time, I've been the one in charge of creating the overlays and site for our use. This was my first true foray into making a reactable site that viewers can see changes in realtime.
          <br><br>This site uses Google Firebase for it's framework alongside HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I'm using the Firestore databases to allow viewers to see realtime updates to our TGS Articles part.
          <br><br>In the second image you can see a snapshot of the Staff HQ. In this part, staff members can log in and update the TGS Articles, the Twitch Dashboard, and the Stream Statistics. This is all done through Firebase's Authentication and Databases in realtime with actual feedback to the user and anyone else online at that time.

          As with most of my projects, I tend to make things that I know I would use. With this project there is a randomizer for Kingdom Hearts 2: Final Mix, this project was created after I couldn't find a tracker that I enjoyed using for it. This is actually one of the first projects that I only worked on backend work for because all of the graphics and lists were created thanks to another tracker that I had found.
          <br><br>
          For information about what a randomizer is, everything in the game that can be aquired is put into a pool and then distributed to any potential check. In this game that can be within a chest, a reward from a boss fight, or even a in-world drop. This tracker has evolved over the last month into what is shown beside.
          <br><br>
          Currently, this project is purely JavaScript and Electron framework. However, once I learn other JS Frameworks, I would like to come back and optimize all of my past projects and port them over to other frameworks.

          This paycheck calculator was my first introduction to AngularJS. I love trying to do calculations especially when it's complicated like figuring taxes. So, I ultimately combined the two and this was the outcome. The calculator can give me figures with in a few cents of accuracy due to each employer having different systems calcualting everything.
          <br><br>As this was my introduction to how AngularJS works, I didn't spend time on formatting the site as I normally would. However, the functions of this site work splended and will get the job done. I more used this project to see how AngularJS and traditional Javascript worked together.
          <br><br>All figures are off of the IRS's tax tables.

          This project started as a personal challenge to make a speedrun randomizer for a game that I love playing. Super Mario Odyssey has collectibles that progress the game in the form of moons. What this randomizer does is take the major moons collected in the game through the speedrun (currently Any% and Festival% speedruns) gets a list of all available moons and provides the player a list of "required" moons.
          <br><br>This randomizer takes cues from other video game randomizers in making routing be something that people have to do on the fly. It doesn't change the game or make it so only those moons can be collected. Essentially, this simply provides a challenge that can change every time.
          <br><br>I was inspired to do this project after seeing <a class='link' title='github.com/JKTKops/Darker-Side-Randomizer' onclick='newTab("https://github.com/JKTKops/Darker-Side-Randomizer")'>JKTKops' Darker Side Randomizer</a> that he created in Java. This made me want to use my growing interest of Electron apps and my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript to try my hand at creating a smaller scale version. This started to only have Any% routing in it and over time I've pushed myself to add more to the project. This has made it one of my stronger focused projects.
          <br><br>This app has two release versions. One being a <a class='link' title='smorando.rampantepsilon.site' onclick="newTab('https://smorando.rampantepsilon.site')">web version</a> where you can play seeds with others without the need to download the randomizer.

          In this project, I had one goal. The goal was to make a desktop app for The Gaming Saloon Network. This app was one of my intermediate projects with Electron. In it, I added an app-like navigation scheme, stream viewing capabilities, staff-level resources, and an embed of our site.
          <br><br>
          This project is far from complete and was put on a backburner during The Gaming Saloon Network Site's redesign. This project is functional but still lacks some fine tuning and feature improvements. As of March 2020, I decided to stop work on this app due to the lack of interest and the fact that it would require a complete rework due to Twitch's updated API.

          One of my earliest projects, this project was done for the company that I first worked for. Their website was really outdated and needed a face-lift and I discussed working on it with the owner's son.
          <br><br>This project was developed in Adobe Dreamweaver using the navigation menus that the program offers. The banner image was completely designed based off of images taken of projects where our material was used.
          <br><br>The site was unfortunately left uncomplete due to some complications that prevented me from completing. As of August 2019, I noticed the site was completely taken down. Thus, I'm providing the offline files that I was using through my portfolio.
          <br><br>Since then, I feel like I've grown as a developer and would have trimmed this site back a lot to give it the same output without all of the files.
